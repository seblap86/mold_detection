# Mold detection - Hunting the silent killer
## Final project by Sebastian Bobeth, Dominik Koppen, Agata PÅ‚ucienik
- Ironhack Data Analytics Bootcamp, Berlin, November 2023
- Project status: Ongoing

## Project aim
In our pursuit to address health risks associated with mycotoxins, we are developing a mold detector for fruits and vegetables. Our model uses image recognition to identify mold on vegetables and fruits, aiding older individuals who are more susceptible to health issues caused by moldy groceries. Furthermore, our product classifies the food category and provides additional information on, e.g., durability and proper storage practice. Our goal is to provide a practical solution to enhance food safety and well-being. The final product is displayed on an interactive interface.

## Tech used
We use Python (Jupyter Notebook; e.g., data wrangling, image processing, training and testing machine learning models, image/output displays) for most steps of the process and HTML to create the interface.

## Timeline
The project will be finished and presented on December 15.

## Datasets
We used the following image dataset for training of the fruit and vegetable classification model:
- "Fruits and Vegetables Image Recognition Dataset"
- 100 training images, 10 test images, 10 validation images in each of 36 fruits/vegetables categories
- [Link to the dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kritikseth/fruit-and-vegetable-image-recognition)

For training the mold / no mold detection model, we web-scraped an image dataset from Bing image search containing mold and no mold. We don't provide this database in this Github repo for copyright reasons but can provide it on request.
